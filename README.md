# TRU Computer Science Club Website

## Intro

Hi there! This is the website for the Computer Science Club at Thompson Rivers University. 

## Building, Testing, Running

You're gonna need Jekyll (and thus Ruby) installed to test out page changes. You can find Jekyll at https://jekyllrb.com/

After you get Jekyll, open a terminal/command prompt inside the directory you cloned to. Then run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start a server on http://locahost:4000

## Tooling

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is a great editor to use, but you can use any editor you like, as long as it doesn't mess up the page encoding (especially on Windows). Jekyll doesn't like that.

## Scripts and Libraries

Bootstrap 3 and Ekko Lightbox are all that are used.

## License

What license?
