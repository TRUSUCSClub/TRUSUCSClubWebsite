    COVID-19 Notice

<p>
    Welcome to the Fall 2020 semester, where we are operating in an online-only capacity due to COVID-19! As you're aware, most if not all of your classes are being run online. So is the Computing Science Club!
</p>

<p>
    We are working on opening up the Fall 2020 Help Lab on our Discord chatroom. If you're not in there, you really should be, as it will prove to be very valuable over the coming months.
</p>

<p>
    You can find information on how to join our Discord chatroom <a href="/discord/index.html">here</a> or by clicking "chatroom" above.

    We look forward to spending the rest of the semester with you!
