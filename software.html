<h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2>
<div>
    <h3>For C/C++ (Networks, OOP, OS, etc)</h3>
    <p><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> is a great editor, and with the C/C++ extension will make your life easier. Additionally, it can be set up so that all you have to do is click "Debug" and your code will run.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h3>Python</h3>
    <p><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> is great for most Python projects, and it's very simple to use. Or, you can also use <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a>.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h3>Java (lots of courses)</h3>
    <p>
        When you're getting started (Java 1, 2) you'll likely be asked to use Dr. Java. Although it's really sucky, it does help in memorization as it doesn't do anything for you. 
    </p>
    <p>
        After that, you can use a real editor such as <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA</a>.
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h3>UML (Software Architecture, OOP)</h3>
    <p>
        There aren't really any good software recommendations for this. If you're on Windows, using the free copy of <a href="#azureedu">Microsoft Visio</a> we get is a pretty solid choice, as it has lots of UML-related templates.
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h3>HTML/CSS/JavaScript/PHP (Web 1, 2)</h3>
    <p>
        Again, <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> is a great editor, is free, and is cross-platform.
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h3>UI/UX Design (HCI)</h3>
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a> is great (and is web-based!), and <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html">Adobe XD</a> is another good option if you don't mind the download.
    </p>
