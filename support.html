        The Computer Science Club runs a semesterly support lab to help students needing some extra help and guidance in
        lower level classes with their assignments and topics. All the hours, and the current status, of the support
        lab can be found on this page.

    <h3>Fall 2020</h3>
    
    <p>
        Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most classes are being delivered online. This is definitely a unique experience for many students. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In the Fall 2020 semester, we will be running a help lab through our Discord chatroom. Through this chatroom, you can either send text messages, or connect with a Support Lab volunteer through voice chat and screen share your problems. 
    </p>
    <p>
        As we work out details, we will be providing more information both on here and through Discord announcements.
