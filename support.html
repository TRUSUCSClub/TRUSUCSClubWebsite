<h1>Support Lab</h1>
<div class="blog-post clearfix">
    <p>The Computer Science Club runs a semesterly support lab to help students needing some extra help and guidance in
        lower level classes with their assignments and topics. All the hours, and the current status, of the support
        lab can be found on this page.</p>

    <h3>Winter 2020</h3>
    
    <p>The support lab is currently <strong> Closed on campus </strong> for the Winter 2020 semester due to the TRU campus shutdown. 
        However, you can still get support online by joining our Discord chatroom! Find out how at <a href="https://trucsclub.ca/discord">https://trucsclub.ca/discord<a/></p>

    <h3>Know your stuff? Volunteer with the Support Lab!</h3>
    <p>Currently, due to school closure the call for volunteers is now closed. However, if you're still interested in helping other students, 
        please come to our <a href="https://trucsclub.ca/discord">Discord chatroom</a> where we are continuing an online-only version of the help lab.

    <h3>Volunteer Survey</h3>
    <p>As a support lab volunteer, we'd appreciated if you could fill out the <a href="//trucsclub.ca/timesheet" />survey</a>
        after each session. This helps the club track demand for course support so that we can better serve students.</p>
